```html
<div class="bg-gray-300 p-4 rounded-lg">
  <p class="text-gray-900 text-lg font-medium">This is some text.</p>
</div>
```

This code snippet uses Tailwind CSS classes to style a div element.  However, if you have a conflicting CSS rule applied globally or within a parent element with higher specificity, the Tailwind classes might not apply as expected. This is a common issue when integrating Tailwind with existing CSS.

For example, imagine there's a global stylesheet with:

```css
p {
  color: blue;
}
```
This will override the `text-gray-900` class in your Tailwind CSS unless you use `!important`, which is generally discouraged.
