To solve this, you have two main options:

1. **Increase the specificity of your Tailwind classes:**  This is generally the preferred approach. You could add a more specific parent selector to your Tailwind classes or modify the global stylesheet.

2. **Use the `!important` flag (use cautiously):**  Add `!important` to your Tailwind CSS classes to forcefully apply them, overriding any other rules.  However, using `!important` can make your CSS harder to maintain in the long run, and should be avoided unless absolutely necessary.

Here's a possible `solution.css` file showing both options:

```css
/* Option 1: Adjust global style to be less specific */
.container p {
  color: blue !important; /*Only affects paragraphs inside container*/
}

/* Option 2: Use !important (use sparingly!) */
.bg-gray-300 p {
  color: gray-900 !important;
}
```
This solution adjusts the global style to be less specific, thereby allowing Tailwind to take precedence.  The `!important` example should only be used as a last resort.
